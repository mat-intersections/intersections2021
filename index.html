          <p class="header-line">Inter/sections is the almost annual event organised by the PhD students of the Media
            and Arts Technology CDT at Queen Mary University London. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic we skipped 2020, but
            are back this year with a fully-online two-day event of talks and workshops. </p>
          <p>Technology is what keeps us connected throughout lockdowns, where we find ourselves physically separated
            from family, friends and colleagues. With the desire to connect with our community and expand our network
            during these isolated times we are very happy to be able to welcome practitioners from various fields of
            media and arts technology to work and talk with us about and with emerging technologies. The schedule for
            Inter/sections 2021 reflects the interdisciplinary nature of the PhD programme and touches on topics from
            making, to e-textiles, to sensory devices and 3D audio. While most of us spend hours and hours staring at
            screens at the moment, this showcase of ideas and hands-on workshops will stimulate conversations of
            multisensory, embodied experiences that technology can offer and invite us to dream about the multisensory
            experience of being together in a physical space.</p>
          <p>The event is split into three blocks. On day 1 we will kick off with an e-textile workshop where you can
            learn how to craft a pompom musical instrument. This will be followed by an interactive panel discussion
            about technologically mediated bodies. Day 2 will be a full day focused on producing and discussing spatial
            audio. </p>

          <h3>DIY e-Textiles Workshop: Craft a Pompom Musical Instrument</h3>
          <p>The event is facilitated by Samantha Topley, a sound artist from Leicester, UK, who works with textiles to
            create handmade electronic musical instruments and interactive sound artwork.
            The workshop will be a hands-on activity during which we will build some <b>pompom synths</b> and
            <b>perform</b> them in a remote and collaborative fashion. The focus of the activity is on crafting
            the interface, as a playful introduction to working with e-textile materials and DIY instrument building.
            The activity will be online - 3.5 hours long (with a short break).
            We will be using a pompom musical instrument <a

          <h3>Bodies/technologies</h3>
          <p>Technologies affect the embodied experience of being a human in this world. Technologies read, interpret
            and mediate bodies. Technological enhancement, care, surveillance and control are topics that play a role in
            the works of the artists Nicola Woodham, Sophie Hoyle and Katie Tindle. We are happy to welcome three
            artists to each present an aspect of their work and join a panel discussion, where we will explore and
            consider how technology can be both empowering and oppressive. </p>

              <b>Nicola Woodham</b> composes experimental music, bringing in free-improvisation with treated voice and
              noise. A year ago she began an intensive journey into creative technology and now hand-makes wearable
              etextile sensors and codes for embodied audio performances. Pre-Covid, she performed in music venues and
              galleries, where she aimed to scale up her audibility and visibility as a disabled womxn. In real
              space/online hybrids she’s enjoying cracking open ways to create presence through haptic feedback and
              sensory ways to make improvised music during her performances. Maximalist in approach, Nicola’s work
              weaves together disparate threads including the governance of disabled bodies,
              neutralising trauma through ritual, the slippery source of the voice. She documents her making on
              www.nicolawoodham.com and her recent release ‘Buffer’ EP is via Bandcamp.

              <b>Sophie Hoyle</b> is an artist and writer whose practice explores an intersectional approach to
              post-colonial, queer, feminist, critical psychiatry and disability issues. Their work looks at the
              relation of the personal to (and as) political, individual and collective anxieties, and how alliances can
              be formed where different kinds of inequality and marginalisation intersect. They relate personal
              experiences of being queer, non-binary and part of the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) diaspora to
              wider forms of structural violence. From lived experience of psychiatric conditions and trauma, or PTSD,
              they began to explore the history of biomedical technologies rooted in state and military surveillance and
              control.

                <b>Katie Tindle</b> is an artist, organiser and educator living in London, originally from the North
                East of England. Her practice is based in writing, installation using moving image and sound, and web
                technologies. This work centres on wellness/illness, the body, poetics, feminist thought and data
                justice. Tindle’s curatorial practice is based around democratisation and demystification of art spaces,
                both online and in person. Tindle studied at Central Saint Martin’s (CSM) and Goldsmiths University of
                London, and currently works at CSM and the Society for Research into Higher Education, and is a member

          <h3>Soundstack Introduction</h3>
          <p>Soundstack is a free event focused on the art and technologies of spatial sound. This year on Friday 26th
            March, Soundstack brings you an online workshop about audio-visual point clouds in Unity using
            photogrammetry, as well as a session dedicated to spatial sound in the browser (we now all need to do it,
            and this is unlikely to change). </p>
          <p>This is an intermediate-level event, and requires some understanding of spatial sound. The sessions will
            introduce you to artist-engineers working at the cutting edge of spatial sound for VR, AR, installations and
            performance. </p>
          <p>You will hear about specific software and techniques, as well as the aesthetic potential of working with
            immersive sound in fixed and real-time settings. In the workshop setting you will have hands-on instruction,
            as well as a demonstration of work, and discussions. </p>

          <h3>Session A: Audiovisual Pointclouds</h3>
          <p>The workshop Audiovisual Pointclouds will allow participants to make 3D scans of any objects to which they
            have access, using free software and their smartphones. They will then bring these objects into the games
            engine Unity, as photogrammetry data. Finally, they will be able to manipulate these data, in order to
            create fully three-dimensional digital artwork which can be taken in any number of creative directions. </p>
          <p>You can either watch the session (passive participation) with an opportunity to ask questions, or get
            feedback from Kathrin as you go (active participation) by applying for a place. Places are limited and will
            require you to submit a Unity project to demonstrate your basic Unity skills.</p>
